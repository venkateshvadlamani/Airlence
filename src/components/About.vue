          <h4>Chief Drone Pilot & Founder, Airlence</h4>

          <p></p>
          <p>I love flying drones and stiching the aerial videos into an amazing story.
             stitching together videos 
            and layering in content for my customers and hanging out with my sisters. </p>
          <p>In my spare time I love playing video games like Minecraft and GTA.</p>
          <p>Airlence is my second venture. My previous project was LANEX a company to match young engineers with local experts.</p>
